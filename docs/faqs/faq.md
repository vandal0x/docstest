## Token

### Is there a Noox token?

We will be releasing $NOOX token with the launch of the community-curated badging protocol. There is currently no Noox token deployed yet. $PreNOOX tokens are temporary tokens to be swapped for $NOOX at an 1:1 ratio once the protocol is live.
<br class="in" />

<!-- ### What is Noox Awakens campaign?

“Noox Awakens” was a community bootstrapping campaign that consisted of four(4) different project rounds, and 0.45% of the total token supply planned will be distributed to all participants who holds their proof-of-participation (i.e. Noox Awaken POAPs and/or Genesis Pass) at the end of the closed beta. The exact date and time of the snapshot will be announced later.
<br class="in" />

### What is Claim-to-Earn?

0.5% of the total token supply is allocated for the Claim-to-Earn rewards during the closed beta.

The campaign is divided into 4 equal batches and each batch lasts for one(1) week. At the end of each batch, the % of $NOOX each user is eligible to receive is calculated by dividing the total number of badges you claimed by the total number of badges claimed for that entire batch.

For example, if a total of 100 badges were claimed during the 1st batch, and if you claimed 10 badges, then you are eligible for 10% of $NOOX for that batch.
<br class="in" /> -->

### Wen Airdrop?

There are two(2) $preNOOX airdrops planned for the closed beta: 1) Noox Awakens, and 2) Claim-to-Earn.

1. Noox Awakens: All users who hold Noox Awakens POAPs and/or Genesis Pass in their wallet at the time of a snapshot will be eligible to claim your respective $preNOOX. Note that a total of three(3) different POAPs were issued for each round of the Noox Awakens campaign, and each POAP is eligible for a separate airdrop reward. Snapshot will be taken towards the end of the closed beta and we will announce the exact time and date soon.
2. Claim-to-Earn: All users who participated in the Claim-to-Earn campaign are eligible for the airdrop at the end of the closed beta. The amount of reward is calculated and announced on the official Noox Discord after each week(batch) of the campaign.
